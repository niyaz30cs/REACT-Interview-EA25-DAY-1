- Name and version.
- Dependency
- Scripts
- Dev Dependencies

- - Readability
- - Component Composition
- - Performance optimization
- - Ecosystem Supports

### Q-6.What is deference between ReactJS and React Native?

|----|----|
|React Js is JavaScript library.|React Native is  Mobile framwork.|
|use to build web application.|use to build cross plateform mobile application.|
V-Dom render data on browser|Native API for mobile component rendering.|
|create Robust animation using css.|Need to use API create Animation.|

### Q-7.difference between statefull and stateless component?
|Statefull|Stateless|
|----|----|
class component is a statefull component.|function component is a stateless component.|
|Require to save the current state of a process|state of the process are not saved|
|Design is completed and heavy data must stored.|Server design is simplifier is complex.|

### Q-1.What is NPM?
***Ans***:-NPM Stands for node package mannager.

- NPM is short for node package manager, an online directory that contains the various already registered open-source packages.
- NPM modules consume the various functions as a third-party package when installed into an app using the NPM command npm install .
- Package management.
- Dependency Management
- Command-line- interface.
- Script.
- Security.
- open source and community.
### Q-2. What is event in React Js?
***Ans:-***

- Events in React JS allow developers to respond to user interaction within their applications quickly and efficiently. 
- An Event in React is an action that is trigger by the user or the system.Example-mouse click,keyboard press or resize are all event.
- React has own event called synthetic event.
- ***Example:-***
- onClick
- onSubmit
- onChange
- onKeyPress
- onMouseOver
- onMouseOut

***Ans***
|Axios|Fetch|
|----|----|
|Easier to work with|Harder to work with|
|Less verbose|More verbose|
|Has to be Compiled|Read directly by browser|
|Third party Library|Vanilla Javascript|
|it is Faster|Little bit Slower|
|Easier to error handler|hard to error handler|
|axios use data property|fetch use body proprty|
|Need install external library|No need to install any Thing|

### Q-1. What is props drilling and state uplifting in ReactJs?
***Ans:-***

 ***Props Drilling:-*** The component at the top and bottom of the stack need access to the state.
To do this without Context, we will need to pass the state as "props" through each nested component. This is called "prop drilling".

- props drilling means data pass parent to child one component to another component.

***State uplifting:-*** Lifting state up is a common pattern that is essential for React developers to know. It helps you avoid more complex (and often unnecessary) patterns for managing your state.

- state uplifting means data transfer child to parent.


### Q-2. What is ContextApi?
***Ans:-*** The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.

- Context API is a (kind of) new feature added in version 16.3 of React that allows one to share state across the entire app (or part of it) lightly and with ease.
- The Context API in React is a way for a component to share data with other components without having to pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree.

### Q-3. What is useState hooks?
***Ans:-***

- The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
- State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.

- useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.
- ***syntax***

const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

### Q-4. What is useEffect?
***Ans:-***

- The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
- useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.
- useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.
- ***syntax:-***

useEffect(setup, dependencies?)

- The useEffect hook is a smooth combination of Reactâ€™s lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount.

### Q-1. Difference between Callback and useCallBack hooks?

|CallBack|useCallBack|
|----|----|
|A callback is function that pass as a argument into another function.|useCallBack is react hook that return a memoized function|
|A callback is typically used to handle event or to pass data between component.|useCallBack is take two argument function and dependency of array|

### Q-2. Why do you need keys in react js ?
***Ans:-*** Keys help React identify which items have changed (added/removed/re-ordered). To give a unique identity to every element inside the array, a key is required.

- Identify which elements are added.
- Identify which elements are updated.
- Identify which elements are removed.

At this point, you may wonder why do we need it? After all, we could identify elements by their id, className, parent/child, index, props, etc. The answer is because of React's Diffing Algorithm.

### Q-3.what is useMemo in ReactJs?
***Ans:-*** The useMemo is a hook used in the functional component of react that returns a memoized value.

- The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value.
- The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
- This can improve performance.
- 


***why use useMeme?***

The basic purpose of the useMemo hook is related to the fact that we try to avoid the unnecessary re-rendering of components and props in our program.

## use cases:-

- Managing DOM element.
- implementing animation and transition.
- strong and accessing previous state value.
- integrating with third party.

### Q-4. What is useReducer hook?
***Ans:-*** The useReducer Hook is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second. useReducer returns an array that holds the current state value and a dispatch function to which you can pass an action and later invoke it.

- The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.
- It allows for custom state logic.
- ***syntax:-***
useReducer(reducer, initialState)
- reducer
- dispatch
- action
- state
- initialState
